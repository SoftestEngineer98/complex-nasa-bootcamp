I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 3
I feel pretty good as this was done as a group effort, but unfortunately with little time I had to finish my other projects I was not able to figure out why my main.js and style.css would not link to my index.html. What I would do differently is speak up more to my peers and EIR, and work more on my time management skills.
